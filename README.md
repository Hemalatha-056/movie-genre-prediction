# Movie-Genre-Prediction

Movie genre prediction is a task in machine learning where algorithms are trained to predict the genre(s) of a movie based on various features or attributes. This task falls under the broader category of text classification or content-based recommendation systems.
Feature Extraction:
Extract relevant features from the data that can be used to train the machine learning model. For example, if the data includes text descriptions, you might use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract features from the text.
Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict the genres of new, unseen movies. The model takes input features (such as a movie synopsis) and outputs predicted genre labels.

Popular libraries for implementing movie genre prediction models in Python include scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) libraries such as NLTK or spaCy for processing text data.
